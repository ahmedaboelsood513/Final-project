**Subject:** Freelance Offer Budget Negotiation

Dear Mr.Michael ezraa,

Thank you for considering me for the freelance project. I appreciate the opportunity and I’m excited about the possibility of collaborating with you.

However, after reviewing the financial offer, I believe that the proposed budget doesn’t fully reflect the scope of the work and the value I bring to the project. With my [specific skill or expertise] and [number of years] of experience in [relevant industry or field], I have successfully completed projects that required a high level of [relevant skills, such as technical expertise, creativity, or strategic thinking]. 

Given the complexity and potential impact of this project, I believe that a revised budget would better align with the level of quality and dedication I am committed to delivering. To provide the best possible results, I would propose a budget adjustment to [your proposed amount], which I feel is a fair reflection of my experience and the value I can offer.

I am confident that with this adjustment, we can achieve outstanding outcomes for your project, and I am more than happy to discuss the details further to ensure we are aligned.

Thank you again for the opportunity, and I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
